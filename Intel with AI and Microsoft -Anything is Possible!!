As Intel uses AI observing that Electrical Pathways become analytically able to virtually 'Think for Themselves'-Steps ahead 
comprehending that the manufacturers of Core Processors that are not all made equal with Super'Voltage Wise'Technology deciding that some Processors need some help along the way -
with necessity, becoming the mother of invention.
The obvious advancement they have made towards using Artificial Intelligence towards pushing heavy traffic within the processors towards the higher eschelons of core to easily 
handle the extra workload- reducing power surging slowing down the response time and who knows what else!is I think a phenomenal achievement!
With no discredit to the Wise and Wonderful Wizards of Microsoft who by all intents configured with Intel, to work ways around this.
Left to their own devices who could have imagined or considered that Core Processors would ably handle the extra workload. 
Just a Spark of Genius giving Core Processors the Power from their supply to admirably 'think for themselves' for direction.

The Jewel in the Crown of the Microsoft Windows 1909 Update in Windows 10 allows us to think for ourselves and create a fashionable guid to our own liking.
Just as core processors are not made equally 'voltage wise'so are our PC's different in many respects- we can rely upon the fact that as we don't ubiquitously think alike it is refreshing to take control
Famously presented to us by Microsoft on the not so proverbial Windows 10 Dashboard,we are able to make the changesp at our own disposal.

Just as Core Processors with a likely 'gendarme' have the tools within to push the heavy traffic to go on the fastest direction-
Microsoft have given users an open Dashboard, with open source simplified tweaking relying upon ourselves to take on the interactive task of 'thinking for ourselves'
How's that for our own end Satisfaction!
